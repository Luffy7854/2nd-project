The project here  is to create a chatbot in Clojure in a teamwork.
We have to follow several conditions which can help any tourists to get precious informations about two kinds of birds : robin and magpie in all parks of this city. 

Our chatbot can give informations, answer simple questions and also simplify the life of foreign tourists effectively.

This chatbot used to be clear, easy to use and follow a ELIZA structure.



## HOW TO START

First, you need to install clojure into UBUNTU, just follow the instruction on: https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started

Then start the chatbot with the command "clojure 2project.clj" and follow the instructions.

## USAGE

REQUIREMENTS : Our chatbot run only in REPL environment.
Only the users who can use this environment can use the chatbot to get informations about Prague city.

If some toursits want to, they can also use another environment which allow clojure program.

To use this simple chatbot.
   - First you have to say "hello"
   - Then talk with the chatbot and ask your question with keywords
   - if you have any other question about keywords you can say "HELP"
   - At the end, when you get all the informations the program closes with "program finish..." .

## Chatbot 


EXAMPLE of chat between any users and chatbot :

           What was the principal color of the animal ?"

## HELP

If the users have any problems or need any informatons they can say "HELP" to get the e-mail which can help them for any request.
The e-mail is : help@praguecollege.cz

In the future, we will be able to involve this chatbot to give more information about any birds and give more precise information about any request of a tourist. For the moment this chatbot gives information about the birds and Park. 

We are open into welcoming contributors only if they are motivated into helping improve this chatbot taking into account users criticizes.
They also have to know Prague City precisely. It will be important for the future of this chatbot.
